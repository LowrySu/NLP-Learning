Method of using a continuous vector to represent words

## ============================

# Abstract

1. Two model to compute continuous vector representations of words from large data.

2. The vector can calculate the similarity of words.

3. Is fast.

# 1. Introduction

1. The previous words are represented by single token, without considering the similarity between different words.

2. Goa1:  the similar words hava short vector distance

3. Goa2: how to be faster and more accurate

# 2. Model Architectures

1. model: neural networks

2. train method: stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation
